**NeoRadium** is a Python library designed to simplify the simulation of physical layer communication pipeline based on the latest **3GPP 5G NR** standard. Its object-oriented architecture effectively hides the complexities involved in different stages of the communication pipeline, enabling you to swiftly develop and run end-to-end simulations on any standard computer.

Wireless communication research often is focused on one particular block or module of the end-to-end communication pipeline (e.g. equalization). However, implementing the entire 3GPP pipeline just to test one block can be time-consuming and cumbersome. This is where **NeoRadium** comes in. It provides the end-to-end communication pipeline functionality based on 3GPP standard while allowing the researchers to customize, study, and evaluate performance of their implementation. It achieves all these capabilities without high-end hardware, complex setup, or costly GPUs. As long as your computer runs Python 3.8+ with a basic setup, you're good to go!

**NeoRadium** includes a comprehensive [Playground](https://ail-wireless.pages.interdigital.com/neoradium/source/Playground/Playground.html), where you can experiment with numerous examples. These examples take the form of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) and explain API details and their usage in practical contexts.
