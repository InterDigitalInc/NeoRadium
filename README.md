**NeoRadium** is a Python library engineered to simplify the simulation of **physical layer communication pipelines** based on the latest **3GPP 5G NR** standard. Its object-oriented architecture effectively abstracts the complexities inherent in different stages of the communication pipeline, enabling rapid development and execution of end-to-end simulations on any standard computer.

Wireless communication research often **focuses** on specific blocks or modules within the end-to-end communication pipeline, such as equalization. However, implementing an entire 3GPP-compliant pipeline solely for the purpose of testing a single block can be both time-consuming and cumbersome. This is where **NeoRadium** proves invaluable. It provides comprehensive end-to-end communication pipeline functionality based on 3GPP standards, empowering researchers to effortlessly customize, study, and evaluate the performance of their unique implementations. All these capabilities are delivered without requiring high-end hardware, complex setups, or costly GPUs. As long as your computer operates with Python 3.9+ and a basic configuration, you are ready to begin.

**NeoRadium** includes a comprehensive [Playground](https://interdigitalinc.github.io/NeoRadium/html/source/Playground/Playground.html), offering numerous examples for experimentation. These examples are presented as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) and provide detailed explanations of API functionalities and their application in practical contexts.
